# Project Overview and Goals

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to predict the National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award rankings based on player statistics from a given season. Predicting the MVP is inherently complex, involving not only objective player performance but also narratives, team success, and voter subjectivity. This project focuses on building quantitative models to approximate the final MVP voting results, specifically the `award_share` metric, and evaluating their ability to rank players accurately.

## 2. Objectives

*   **Predict Award Share:** Develop regression models to predict the proportion of MVP votes a player receives (`award_share`).
*   **Rank Players:** Use the predicted `award_share` to rank players within each season.
*   **Evaluate Ranking Accuracy:** Assess the models' performance using metrics specifically designed for ranking tasks (NDCG@k, Custom Rank Accuracy).
*   **Explore Modeling Approaches:** Compare the effectiveness of various machine learning and deep learning techniques, ranging from simple baselines to complex neural network architectures.

## 3. Modeling Approaches Explored

The project investigates several types of models:

*   **Traditional Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor (`predict_mvp_rank.py`, `predict_mvp_rank_ndcg.py`).
*   **Simple Neural Network:** A basic MLP designed for efficiency and interpretability (`simple_nn_mvp_ndcg.py`).
*   **Advanced MLP Architectures:** More complex Multi-Layer Perceptrons incorporating techniques like residual connections, attention mechanisms, layer normalization, and branched structures (`mlp_nn.py`, `mlp_nn_ndcg.py`, `predict_award_share_for_rank.py`).
*   **Transformer-Based Model:** Utilizing self-attention mechanisms inspired by the Transformer architecture for potentially capturing complex feature interactions (`transformer_mvp_ndcg.py`).
*   **Ensemble Model:** Combining features from both MLP and Transformer-style architectures to leverage the strengths of different approaches (`ensemble_mvp_ndcg.py`).

## 4. Key Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using:

*   **Standard Regression Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (RÂ²) for the `award_share` prediction task.
*   **Custom Rank Accuracy:** A project-specific metric evaluating the accuracy of the top-5 predicted ranks with partial credit for predictions close to the actual rank (`calculate_rank_accuracy` function).
*   **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k):** A standard information retrieval metric adapted for ranking quality, focusing on the top `k` (typically 5) players (`calculate_ndcg` function).
*   **Top-k Comparison:** Direct comparison of the actual top-k players vs. the predicted top-k players (`save_top5_comparison` function).
