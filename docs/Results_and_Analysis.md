## 2. Results Summary

Model performance evaluated using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 5 (NDCG@5):

| Model              | Average NDCG@5 |
|:-------------------|:--------------:|
| Linear Regression  | 0.580          |
| Random Forest      | 0.663          |
| Gradient Boosting  | 0.678          |
| Simple MLP         | 0.799          |
| Advanced MLP       | 0.802          |
| Transformer        | 0.772          |
| Ensemble           | 0.759          |

The Advanced MLP model achieved the best performance in ranking players according to MVP voting patterns.

## 3. Analysis of Award Share Prediction

*   **Overall Fit:** Discuss the R² values. How much variance in `award_share` do the models explain?
*   **Prediction Errors:** Analyze the MAE and MSE. How large are the typical prediction errors in terms of award share points?
*   **Vote Getters vs. All Players:** Compare the performance metrics for all players versus only those who received votes. Do models struggle more with predicting zero vs. non-zero shares, or with predicting the magnitude of non-zero shares?
*   **Visual Insights:** Refer to the actual vs. predicted scatter plots (`award_share_actual_vs_predicted.png`, `award_share_vote_getters_actual_vs_predicted.png`). Do the plots show systematic biases (e.g., underpredicting high award shares)?

## 4. Model Architecture Comparison

*   **Complexity vs. Performance:** Did the more complex architectures (Transformer, Ensemble, Advanced MLP) significantly outperformed the simpler ones (Baseline ML, Simple MLP) after accounting for potential overfitting?
*   **Feature Engineering Impact:** How important was the feature selection step? (Referencing correlations or PCA results if available).
*   **Strengths/Weaknesses:** Briefly discuss the perceived advantages or disadvantages of each approach based on the results.
